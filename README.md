Based off previous information on successful Kickstarter campaigns over the last few years, Louise should start her campaign between the 2nd and 3rd quarters of the year. Campaigns that were started between May and July had high success rates. She should also try to lower her Kickstarter goal to about $5000. The average failed Kickstarter campaigns had a goal of $10,000, so she should try to stay away from that number. Lowering her Kickstarter campaign goal will make it more likely for her campaign to succeed.

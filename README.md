## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
---
This analysis was performed by looking at the outcomes of Kickstarter campaigns that fell under the theater category. A PivotChart was created to filter the Kickstarter data by looking at the theater campaigns and whether they were successful, failed, or were canceled over a number of years. This is displayed in the form of a line chart with markers. This was done to see what months tend to have the most successful campaigns.

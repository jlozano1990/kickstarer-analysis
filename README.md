# Kickstarter Analysis
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
---
The purpose of this project is to visualize Kickstarter outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals to best advise Louise on what she should do to launch her own successful play.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
---
This analysis was performed by looking at the outcomes of Kickstarter campaigns that fell under the theater category. A PivotChart was created to filter the Kickstarter data by looking at the theater campaigns and whether they were successful, failed, or were canceled over a number of years. This is displayed in the form of a line chart with markers. This was done to visualize trends in terms of what months tend to have the most successful theater campaigns.

### Challenges and Difficulties encountered
---
There was not very much challenge when it came to analyzing this dataset or displaying it. A challenge that may arise for someone is not filtering the data in a way that properly displays the results we'd like to show.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
---
This analysis was performed by looking at what goals Kickstarter campaigns had set for themselves and seeing what percentage of campaigns achieved that goal and what percentage of campaigns did not. A PivotChart was created to display the percentage of successful campaigns and compare them to the percentage of failed campaigns in the theater subcategory of campaigns. This was displayed in the form of a line graph.

### Challenges and Difficulties encountered
A challenge I faced when trying to display the information was that the line graph was displaying incorrectly for me. The problem was I hadn't properly organized how I wanted Excel to show the information, so the <1000 category was somewhere in the middle, and the rest of the categories were not displaying properly because of that. Once I realized the issue, I organized it the way it should've been organized.
## Results
---
Based on the **Outcomes Based on Launch Date** line graph, we can conclude that the best month to launch a new Kickstarter trying to fund a play in the US would be May. In the month of May, we had the most ***successful*** Kickstarters for new plays. We can also conclude that one should try to avoid launching a new play in the time around October. That was when we saw the most ***failed*** Kickstarters for new plays.

When it comes to the **Outcomes Based on Goals** line graph, we can conclude that it is best to set a goal between
